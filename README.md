The Sample_Shell_Script.sh file is a simple program that you will run in your terminal on the Raspberry Pi.

## Instructions

Clone your copy onto your local Raspberry Pi.

In this project's directory on your Pi run the shell script with the following command:

``
$ ./Sample_Shell_Script.sh

When you run it for the first time you will see one error message and one mistake.

Open the script with the Text Editor and using what you have learned from the Shell Workshop tutorial and some online research, fix the code so that the shell script runs correctly.
